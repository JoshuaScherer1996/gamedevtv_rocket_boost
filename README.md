#  Rocket Boost - a project for the C# 3D GameDev.Tv course

This repository contains the game I developed for the GameDev.Tv course C# 3D on [udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/unitycourse2/). I used this course with the purpose of quickly getting into unity 6. The topics covered were as follows.

## Topics
1. Importing custom asset packages.
2. Working with imported assets and fixing material display errors (displayed as pink).
3. Understanding the difference between size and scale by using one standard cube as approximately 1 meter.
4. Theoretically talked about encapsulation, namespaces, classes and the Unity documentation.
5. Introduction to the InputSystem namespace.
6. Use parent / child objects to sperate the concerns of functionality (scripts etc.) and looks (models). 
7. Simple introduction to callbacks.
8. Using the event method OnEnable().
9. Binding multiple buttons as inputs through the new InputSystem.
10. Using force to move objects.
11. Learned about artwork protection via fbx models and prefab variants.
12. TBD
