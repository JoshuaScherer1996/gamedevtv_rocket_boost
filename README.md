#  Rocket Boost - a project for the C# 3D GameDev.Tv course

This repository contains the game I developed for the GameDev.Tv course C# 3D on [udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/unitycourse2/). I used this course with the purpose of quickly getting into unity 6. The topics covered were as follows.

## Topics
1. Importing custom asset packages.
2. Working with imported assets and fixing material display errors (displayed as pink).
3. Understanding the difference between size and scale by using one standard cube as approximately 1 meter.
4. Theoretically talked about encapsulation, namespaces, classes and the Unity documentation.
5. Introduction to the InputSystem namespace.
6. Use parent / child objects to sperate the concerns of functionality (scripts etc.) and looks (models). 
7. Simple introduction to callbacks.
8. Using the event method OnEnable().
9. Binding multiple buttons as inputs through the new InputSystem.
10. Using force to move objects.
11. Learned about artwork protection via fbx models and prefab variants.
12. Using relative force.
13. Usage of the FixedUpdate lifecycle method.
14. Difference between relative and local positions.
15. Using Time.fixedDeltaTime.
16. Learned more about child / parent relationships inside the hierarchy.
17. Using pivot and center for the tool handle position.
18. Using parameters in methods.
19. Learned about some settings for the game view like aspect ratio, resolution and maximised view.
20. Learned about Update Method and Blend Update Method to prevent camera jittering.
21. Using Cinemachine Posiion Composer.
22. Learned even more about prefabs, prefab variants and fbx prefabs.
23. Simple bug fixing like weird physic behaviours.
24. Using dampening (formerly known as drag).
25. Working with the physics settings inside the project settings.
26. Using the 3 components of audio: File, Source and Listener.
27. Using isPlaying, Play and Stop.
28. Controling audio volume.
29. Using switch statements.
30. Introduction to scenes for level management.
31. Using SceneManager methods for game logic.
32. Using the Invoke method for delays.
33. Shotly touched on communication between scripts.
34. Best practices for code structure.
35. Used structure for variables: parameters -> cache -> state.
36. Using different audioclips with PlayOneShot.
37. Changing the skky with custom skyboxes.
38. Customizing the directional light.
39. Using bools as conditions.
40. Particles as game objects.
41. Emitters as the source of the particles.
42. Particle systems.
43. Manipulating particles.
44. Selecting and working on prefabs from the Hierarchy.
45. Using methods to play the particles.
46. Using logic operators.
47. Creating debug keys for qucker debugging and testing.
48. Using wasPressedThisFrame.
49. Using Mesh Colliders for more complex objects.
50. Designing immerive levels.
51. Dressing the set properly.
52. Using colors to communicate behaviour with the player.
53. Manipulating the global volume.
54. Manipulating Depth of Field.
55. Implementing different types of lights.
56. Main Directional light.
57. Environment Lighting.
58. Scene Lights.
59. Player Light.
60. Intro to light baking.
61. Using the [Mathf](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Mathf.html) library.
62. Using method PingPong.
63. Using method Lerp.
64. Using Application.Quit().
65. Building the game for different platforms.
